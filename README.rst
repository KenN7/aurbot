INTRODUCTION
============

*Aurbot* is a AUR [#]_ (Arch Linux Repository) automatic builder of packages.
Its goal is to track updates of AUR packages to build new versions, send mail
report and push the new package inside a binary repository.


*Aurbot* is piloted by its command line tools *aurbot* and timed action, like
rebuild or mail report should be done via cron.

*Aurbot* is written in Python 3.2.


DEPENDENCIES
============
- Python 3.2 [#]_

SECURITY
========
You must take in consideration that *Aurbot* build, so execute, code (PKGBUILD)
from a remote location (AUR), pushed by users from Internet.

Package are built in a clean chroot environment, but this is not an true
security feature as explain in `man (2) chroot`.

So you should automatically build package from user you trust. At least a
little.

To avoid kind of issue *Aurbot* doesn't automatically build new package version
if owner of package if orphan or have changed from the previous build.
